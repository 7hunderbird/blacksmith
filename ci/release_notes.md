# Bug Fixes

- Fixed a cognition bug whereby the names of the FindPlan
  parameters were reversed from universal usage, but so was their
  application in the code (essentially, a noop oops).

- Fixed an inadvertant name/ID mismatch that only manifest as a
  "bug" when the service ID and service Name did not match in the
  Blacksmith catalog.
